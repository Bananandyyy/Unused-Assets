# Unused Assets PREBUILD-1

*by Gizmo*

**DISCLAIMER:** This mod is **NOT DONE YET!** This is only about 1/8 of everything I want to add to it. I will roll out more and more features for testing, but know that this isnt final. Once I begin releasing alphas of the mod, that will mean I am getting close to a release. 

Welcome to *Unused Assets*! This is a mod idea by me to add things that were scrapped, unused, or planned to minecraft. This mod also went further to add parity features from other versions of Minecraft. Currently, I have features from Bedrock Edition and Education Edition, but I will be adding stuff from Minecraft Earth and Dungeons too.

If you would like to help me out, I would be overjoyed. Whether it's something as simple as suggesting a feature to something as complex as writing code or optimizing my work, I would really appreciate any help I can get. Keep in mind though, **ALL SUGGESTIONS NEED TO STAY ON TOPIC.** If what you are suggesting was a considered feature in minecraft(any version of the game), then by all means, let me know. Otherwise, please don't ask me to add something that was never considered to be in the game. 

I will be keeping a list of everything I want to add or is in the process of being added very soon. It will be posted here in the readme as a link. Stay tuned!

I appreciate you checking out my mod. It means the world to me if you consider giving it a shot. Love you all <3
